# qwarc
qwarc is a framework for rapidly archiving a large number of URLs with little overhead. This is achieved primarily by using many parallel connections (including across multiple processes) and not employing any HTML parsing or other processing.

***Use qwarc responsibly. It can easily overwhelm web servers.***
